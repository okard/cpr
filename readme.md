libcpr - C Portable Library
===================================

Extends C Standard Library 
Written in ANSI C99

## Principles

* ANSI C99
* KISS
* Lightweight
* Cross Platform

## Planned Features

* Process Handling
* File/Directory Handling
* Thread Handling
* Memory Tools
* Event Handling
* Network Handling

## Why?

There are some other c base libraries like netscape portable runtime (NSPR) 
,apache portable runtime (apr) and of course the glib library. Why develop
an another one? Because i don't like them and because they don't match my
requirements perfectly, and for learning purposes.
